## Manage subscriptions

Where I work, I end up getting a lot of requests from our customer service department to either update somebody's email, name, or to unsubscribe them from our lists. When you have 20+ lists over multiple services, this sucks.

With this, it is easier to do this all in one shot, in one place. Whether the customer service people can do it, or even if I'm still stuck doing it, it is much less of a pain.
